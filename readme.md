#My Git Workspace

My Git Workspace has a custom prompt. My name is in purple and the directory
name is in blue.  If I change directory (cd) to a Git repository, the prompt
shows in green which commit I have currently checked out.

This configuration is also cool the visualize the edition workflow. If I change
something without commiting, the prompt will show a star, for instance, (master
\*). Moreover, it has tab completion set up for git commands.

In order to have my bash configurations follow the instructions bellow (three
files mentioned are available at https://github.com/pdelfino/git-udacity

Save git-completion.bash file in your home directory with the name git-completion.bash.

Save git-prompt.sh in your home directory with the name git-prompt.sh.

Download bash\_profile\_course.

I am using Linux/Ubuntu, so I needed to to name this file .bashrc instead
of .bash\_profile.
